### What I built

- Designed and developed an AI-driven web application that summarizes user-provided text into concise, readable outputs.
- Implemented a dynamic, responsive UI in Tailwind CSS with an interactive, sticky header to display user-specific session history.
- Built REST API endpoints to interface with external AI models, optimizing performance and real-time processing of content.
- Persisted user data and generated files to S3 for durable storage.
