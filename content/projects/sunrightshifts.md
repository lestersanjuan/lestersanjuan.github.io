### What I built

- Centralized team operations into a single online hub, enabling streamlined collaboration and resource management.
- Integrated automated scheduling with fairness and policy constraints, reducing manual workload and scheduling time by 20%.
- Implemented auth, roles, user-facing React interface, and admin dashboards.
- Ran iterative usability testing sessions to validate reliability, friction, and navigation.
