### What I built

- Designed a dynamic scheduling system for part-time work leveraging Python and graph-based optimization.
- Built heuristics to produce optimal shifts for 30+ employees across locations with zero conflicts.
- Accounted for availability, shift preferences, and fairness in workload distribution.
- Integrated an intuitive interface and generated real-time notifications and conflict-free scheduling suggestions.
- Reduced schedule creation time for the restaurant by 30%.
