### What I built

- Developed and trained a model using DistilBERT embeddings and PyTorch for sentiment classification.
- Engineered SERP-text embeddings to transform review text into high-dimensional vectors for machine learning.
- Applied dropout regularization and custom loss function improvements; achieved ~25% error reduction over baseline models.
- Optimized training pipelines with adaptive learning rates and class balancing for generalization.
