### What I built

- Engineered efficient communication channels between front-end and back-end systems for responsive UX.
- Utilized FaunaDB to enable robust data storage, retrieval, and real-time updates.
- Collaborated with the client to clarify objectives; translated needs into actionable features and milestones.
- Created Figma wireframes and user flows; ran testing on journey paths to reduce friction.
